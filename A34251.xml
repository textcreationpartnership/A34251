         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>And firſt indeed they think, that by this very means the Majeſtie of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures is not a little derogated and detra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted from, for that both their ſufficiency and perſpicuity ſeem to be ſuſpected and doubted of; to wit, as if they either did not fully and ſufficiently contain all things, that are neceſſary and profitable
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:42753:7"/> for every Chriſtian Congregation to know, believe, hope and do, or at leaſt did not uſe thoſe forms of ſpeaking, which do clearly and perſpicuouſly e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough expreſs thoſe Divine Senſes or Meanings, which are chiefly ſavingly neceſſary and available to be believed, but had need of Mens phraſes and forms, for the right underſtanding of them, and application and uſe to make a due difference between Truth and falſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood. From whence afterward they ſay it comes to paſs, that the authority of the Scriptures is more and more weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and at length wholly falleth, and is transferred by degrees to thoſe forms of Men as either more perfect, or the more clear diſcoverers of what is right and falſe. And certainly the experience of many ages ſeemeth not a little to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm theſe Mens opinions, in which (ſay they) for the moſt part it uſually fell out, that, after forms of Confeſſions and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clarations began to be in eſteem, and the ſaid honour to be given to them, as though they did moſt fully expreſs the hidden and involved ſences of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and moſt clearly and plainly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:42753:7"/> thoſe things whichare neceſſarily to be held by the Churches of Jeſus Chriſt, the Majeſty and Authority of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures began by little and little to decline, and the truth as alſo the neceſſity of all Judgments and Opinions pertaining to the buſineſs of Religion to depend upon thoſe forms; in ſo much indeed, that waving and undervaluing the Sacred Scripture, they appealed unto them as the moſt certain Squares or Levels, and unexceptionable Rules, and he that ſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved but a fingers breadth from them, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though moved thereto out of a regard to the Scriptures, was without any fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther proof accuſed and condemned of Hereſie. And though at the beginning, and in the very Cradles or Infancy of Forms, as they ſay, it fell not out, but alſo over and above by Cautions, or Reſtricti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and Proteſtations, and other ways of that kind, they obviated and withſtood the ſame; yet in tract of time, by little and little their Authority prevailed and increaſed, and through ſecret increaſings by intervals and degrees it was inſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly eſtabliſhed and confirmed; until at length, having ſpread its roots deep, it
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:42753:8"/> began in a manner to over-top the very Scriptures. So by this means in proceſs of time ſome Oecumenical Councils, and Forms of Belief, or general Creeds, which were concieved and maintained in them, began to be ſo highly valued, that a like and equal Authority was given to them the Goſpels themſelves by the moſt of men. Yea further, even thoſe things, that were diſputed &amp; determin'd by one ſingle <hi>Auguſtine</hi> againſt <hi>Pelagius,</hi> at length in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs oftime were advanc'd to that Dignity and Authority, (and that even among thoſe who otherwiſe are not wont to ſet much by the Authority of Councils and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers) that it is enough to condemn any one that teacheth in the Church, if his opinion only ſeem to come near to <hi>Pela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gius.</hi> And that it doth commonly ſo fall out in other queſtions of Faith, and hath fallen out from every age paſt they do very ſpeciouſly affirm. In brief, theſe ſeem not to complain in vain, that all Forms uſually do together with their age receive the ſtrength and increaſes of too much Authority; and that howſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever often-times they ſeem not openly and manifeſtly to be advanced and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moted
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:42753:8"/> to an unmeaſurable greatneſs, yet they become by degrees not withſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing (even cautions &amp; proteſtations to the contrary notwithſtanding) the immuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Canons of Faith, and at leaſt ſecunda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Rules and Levels, and that indeed by ſo ſecret and imperceptible motions and advances, that they are found of a certain not to come, but to have come, nor to grow, but to have grown to the top of more than humane Authority and height of ſupreme Dignity.</p>
            <p>They ſuppoſe alſo that theſe Forms do mightily endammage and prejudice the Liberty of Churches, or Conſcience and Propheſie; for that where they are admitted into the Church, it is impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble but that forthwith a tyrannical Law be brought in at the back door, ſo that a man may not think, ſpeak, write, teach, compare and interpret the Scriptutes but according to what they preſcribe; and to call them into doubt, or to contradict them, though modeſtly, is thought an heinous wickedneſs. Nor do they want their pretence: <hi>viz.</hi> That the publick Peace of the Church may be preſerved entire, Confuſion avoided, and Liberty
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:42753:9"/> turn not into Licentiouſneſs: from whence further (they ſay) it comes to paſs, that none, (eſpecially if it be believed that the Common-Wealth alſo is inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſſed therein) durſt either inquire into thoſe Formes, and examine the Opinions that are contained in them by the ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dard of Truth, or if any one called upon for parts and induſtry for that end ſhall inquire into them, and in his judgment find ſome things to be falſe, he cannot without apparent danger publiſh, and diſcover them for the amendment of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. And that indeed by this means ſuch like Forms of Confeſſions and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clarations did terminate in moſt rigid bonds, and more than Adamantine Fet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, wherewith Liberty together with Truth are moſt ſtraitly tied up, and that Errour, which is once received and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, becomes ſtable and firm, yea eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, they affirm that a large gap is opened by theſe very Confeſſions and Declarations for Schiſms and Separati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; becauſe (as they have been hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to uſed) they have been the open and publick ſigns of diſſenſions, by which,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:42753:9"/> no otherwiſe then by certain partition<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>walls, Chriſtians, who ought to be moſt ſtrictly joyned together, and who in very deed agree in the main of ſaving do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, are divided each from other, whilſt<note place="margin">1 Cor, 1. 12.</note> one indeed ſaith, I am of <hi>Paul,</hi> another, I am of <hi>Gephas,</hi> another, I am of <hi>Apollos,</hi> another, I am of Chriſt: and every one believeth that the purity of Religion, and the hope of immortal life conſiſteth with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in his particular Congregation: So that whoſoever belongeth not thereto, he is almoſt judged altogether excluded out of Heaven and the Kingdom of Jeſus Chriſt. Whence it is neceſſary that there ariſe and flow, as it were from a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual Spring, perpetual and immortal ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treds, and diviſions of minds and affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions.</p>
            <p>Theſe for the moſt part are the chief<note place="margin">A general Anſwer.</note> props, on which the firſt and ſecond ſort rely, and whereby they ſupport their o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion: ſpecious indeed they are, if viewed, at firſt ſight, for that they make ſhew of no ordinary zeal for the Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of God's Word, for Liberty of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, for the Peace and Concord of Churches: yet ſuch, as if more nearly
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:42753:10"/> looked into, have not appeared to us of ſo great weight, as that for their ſakes we ſhould deem our ſelves bound to deſiſt from our purpoſe of publiſhing this De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration of ours. For doubtleſs they ſeem not undeſervedly to reprove ſo much the thing it ſelf, as the corruption and abuſe of the thing, which (as a Wen to a fair body) oftentimes is wont to grow and cleave even unto thoſe things, which are beſt and moſt ſovereignly wholeſome in themſelves, and through a more ſharp viewing of the vice, and otherwiſe moſt juſt hatred of the abuſe to be carried and fall unawars even into a deteſtation of the very thing it ſelf. Which that it may be plain, it will be worth our labour to premiſe ſome what of the nature, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity, utility and right uſe of Confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions or Declarations. For from thence it will moſt clearly appear and become manifeſt, both how greatly they are miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken, who are wholly averſe from them, and reject them one with another, and what is our end and ſcope in the putting<note place="margin">What is the true uſe and end<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of Confeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</note> forth of this.</p>
            <p>As for Confeſſions then, or Declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations in general, they are nothing but
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:42753:10"/> clear and manifeſt expoſitions of our Faith propounded and laid down in a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain method, wherein more or fewer, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>their by word or writing, diſcover their judgment concerning points of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Religion, and make it known to the Chriſtian World, for the clearing up of Divine Truth, the cutting off Calumnies, wherewith innocent perſons are oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, and the edifying of Churches in true Faith and peace. This at length is the proper, true and genuine nature and ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius of Confeſſions and Declarations, from which we are to make judgment of their true both neceſſity, and utility, and no ways from the diſpoſition and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign of thoſe, who have oftentimes abuſed Confeſſions and Declarations to far o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther different ends. For thoſe things have not been the faults of the Declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, but of the Declarers, and not the uſes, but abuſes of Confeſſions, and they ſuch as might eaſily but for our ſelves be ſevered from the Forms of Confeſſions themſelves.</p>
            <p>That theſe kind of Forms indeed are<note place="margin">That they are not preciſely neceſſary.</note> not preciſely and abſolutely neceſſary we willingly grant, and therefore do we not
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:42753:11"/> like of their opinion, whom we mention'd in the fourth place, who account them at leaſt for ſecondary Symbols of Faith, and who determine or maintain that they are preciſely neceſſary, if not to the being, yet at leaſt to the well-being of a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Church. For where a right and concordant or unanimous underſtanding of the Scriptures hath its place, there ſimply is no need of other Forms of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief, or expreſſions, but what are in the Scriptures themſelves: and thoſe Forms which are in the Scriptures, they are ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient unto Faith and Salvation; and if one bring with him an honeſt, and docile mind, and ſtudious of Divine Truth, for the diſcerning of them, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all uſe thoſe means, which he ought to uſe, and which become a Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der earneſtly deſirous of ſo great things, they are ſo clear and perſpicuous, that they may and ought at all times a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundantly to ſuffice every Chriſtian to draw from thence both for himſelf and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers a moſt perfect Declaration of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine meanings. For verily it cannot be juſtly doubted, but that thoſe Forms and Phraſes, wherein God himſelf and
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:42753:11"/> our Lord Jeſus Chriſt were pleaſed long ſince to expreſs and declare the meanings of their mind to private and ordinary and unlearned men, are alſo at this day ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent for us to underſtand and declare thoſe very ſame meanings; ſince to that end they are no leſs left of God and delivered by the Scripture to us than unto them, that from them we might draw and fetch thoſe things, which concern the Worſhip of God, and our own and others everlaſting Salvation. From whence it follows, that it is altogether poſſible, that the Church of Chriſt may not only be, but that it may alſo well be without ſuch like humane Forms.</p>
            <p>In the mean time though ſuch Forms<note place="margin">That yet they are uſeful and lawful.</note> are not preciſely neceſſary, yet are they not therefore alſo to be judged unprofita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and conſequently unlawful and hurt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful. For if Propheſyings, or Interpret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of the Scriptures are not unprofita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, yea rather if they be ſome-times in certain reſpects neceſſary, which ſeveral Teachers and Paſtours propoſe in Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſities and Churches, or which other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe are performed in Chriſtian Aſſemb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies, when for the informing of the igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant,

                  </gap>.</note> it cannot verily ſeem unprofitabe, much leſs unlawful or hurtful, if more Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters of Jeſus Chriſt do by mutual con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents, joint ſtudies and endeavours, for the greater illuſtration or clearing up of divine Truth, removing of ſlanders, the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>difying of the generality or the moſt of men, or other holy and pious ends, pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly open and declare their judgment upon the ſame meanings of Scripture, and that in certain compoſed Forms.</p>
            <p>Yea further, if you ſhall duly conſider<note place="margin">That they are ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times alſo neceſſary.</note> the matter without affection and preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice, we ſhall find that thoſe times may happen, wherein ſuch Declarations ought to ſeem not only profitable, but alſo very neceſſary. For if foul and groſs errours, noxious to Chriſtian Religion and piety, ſhould ſeize on our age, if neceſſary heads of belief ſhould be negle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, or be minded but by the by, or thoſe
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:42753:12"/> that are not neceſſary be earneſtly urged as neceſſary, as alſo profitable doctrines not be diſtinguiſhed from thoſe that are neceſſary, as they ought, laſtly, if mens conſciences ſhall be bound up by humane inventions or devices, and every thing, though never ſo, falſe be palliated and cloathed with Scripture words and expreſſions, there is certainly a neceſſity laid upon all and every Chriſtian, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſially upon Paſtours of Churches, ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly to conſider and adviſe among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, by what means they may with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand ſo many and great evils; and, if they ſhall perceive that thoſe blind miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable mortals may profitably and pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently be holpen by a more clear propoſal and elucidation or diſcovery of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine meanings, than hath been formerly made, as it were by a Torch lighted in the dark, unanimouſly and as it were with joint forces to agree and conſpire, how they may diſcover and ſet before their eyes thoſe divine ſenſes and mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings in certain Forms now long ſince with profit received and familiar, if per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>adventure by the help of theſe they that err may be delivered out of the ſaid deep
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:42753:13"/> darkneſs, and be reduced into the right way of everlaſting Salvation. In the next place, if it fall out that thoſe, who perform this profitable ſervice to the Chriſtian Common-wealth, ſhould notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, as it uſually comes to paſs, be loaded with Calumnies, be ſoyled with foul and diſhoneſt ſuſpicions, and as it were over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelmed with a certain deluge of falſe accuſations, as the Patrons of all the wicked opinions in the World, who hang out as it were upon new poſts old Hereſies either all or ſome of them, dig up again out of Hell or their Grave Errours long ſince condemned, who hold nothing firm, nothing ſolid in Religion, and are divided and ſevered among themſelves by ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny and ſo monſtrous Opinions, that they may juſtly ſeem rather Monſters of men, then Chriſtians; who is there who will not think them like to do a work worth their pains, yea that will not think them by ſome neceſſity conſtrained hereunto, by a publick and ſolemn Declaration to obviate ſo atrocious and enormous ſlan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, and by an ingenuous Confeſſion of their judgment to teſtifie to the Chriſtian World, what and what manner of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:42753:13"/> they are in Religion, and what in very deed they think touching the chief heads of belief, and by this unblamable means, as by a bolt &amp; bar firmly ſet againſt thoſe infamous revilings and ſlanders, to vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicate and approve or commend to all good men the integrity of their good name and eſteem, and the innocency of their lives? Eſpecially if they ſee, that, unleſs they do it, all good men even the beſt will be eſtranged from them, the weak will be turned aſide from the love of the Truth, or elſe that no light ſcru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples will be caſt into their minds, that an occaſion will be given to many, in other reſpects in no wiſe bad men, to continue in their errours, or to return, as it were to their vomit, to their former filthineſs which they had left, that their Friends will be withdrawn from all affection of good-will towards them, and violently ſeparated from their fraternity, that more plenteous matter will be miniſtred to their Enemies and Foes to calumniate, and conſequently that through the ſide of their wronged reputation the Truth of God will be wounded, and all their labour, care, induſtry and pains, hitherto ſpent,
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:42753:14"/> or further to be ſpent in the promoting of the ſame, will be rendred unprofitable and fruitleſs? Certainly he that is toucht with any deſire of the publick good, any care of the glory of God, any deſire of the truth and peace of the Church, he cannot but believe, and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly conclude, that in ſuch a caſe there is ſome kind of neceſſity laid upon thoſe men, if they can with a good conſcience, and men of higheſt degree and loweſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree require it, even in conceived Forms of Declarations to purge themſelves from thoſe falſe reports and calumnies, and to teſtifie to the whole Chriſtian World their innocency. Nor indeed can it ſeem ſufficient for the waſhing away of the ſaid Calumnies, if they contain them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves within the meer and bare expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the Scripture, and deliver their Opinions or Judgments in ſo many Scripture-Words and Phraſes.

<pb n="21" facs="tcp:42753:15"/> our belief, or for ſuch Forms, which do not define, or determine, what is to be held for true, or falſe, what is to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved, or not to be believed, after what manner any thing is to be expreſſed, or uttered; but which only may make known and teſtifie, what they hold for true and falſe, what they believe, or do not believe, how they expreſs the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of their Mind, whoſe own thoſe Forms and Declarations are. For if they be had in no other account, or greater e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteem, there is no danger that their Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority (we ſay not) ſhould be equalled, much leſs be preferred before the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, but that they find not indeed any place, though the loweſt in the Church. For doubtleſs, as we have already ſaid before, they will not then be held for Squares and Rules of Faith, whereby Truth, or Falſhood, Hereſie, or Errour may and ought to be known; and which are publiſhed for that end, that by them what is true or falſe may be known, and diſcovered or ſound; but only for bare Signals and Symbols or Tokens, which only ſhow and declare, what the Authors believed and judged of thoſe and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:42753:16"/> Articles and Meanings of Chriſtian Religion. And truly if we conſult the ancient Annals of the Church, they who firſt put forth ſuch Symbols, Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Canons, Confeſſions and Declarati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, had no other deſign, aim or end, but thereby to teſtifie, not what was to be believed, but what they themſelves believed; and that theſe Symbols, &amp;c. ſhould be even inſtead of Watch-Towers, to declare &amp; ſhew to the unwary and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prudent the Shelves and Quicks of Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours that were hurtful to Piety and Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, or alſo to ſerve againſt Calumni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ators, for Apologies, whereby every one might underſtand, how far they were from thoſe Errours, Blaſphemies, and Crimes, which through Calumny were by men ill-imployed faſtened upon them. And certainly if all Declarations and Confeſſions had at all times kept within theſe bounds, they had not indeed at any time, obtained any Dictator-like Digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty or Authority, much leſs greater than, or equal to the Scriptures in the Church. Wherefore that the Church may in the firſt place alway hold this firm &amp; unalter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, we are to endeavour again and again,
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:42753:16"/> and therefore eſt-ſoon upon all occaſions to inculate upon Churches, and in the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Forms of our Confeſſions and Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations accurately to expreſs, That they indeed ought not to be received for cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Judices or Diſcoverers, much leſs for Judges of the true Sences or Meanings, <hi>viz.</hi> of Scripture, but only for the Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of thoſe Sences or Meanings, which the Authors thereof have held for true, and that they were publiſhed to that end. If that be done, theſe three abuſes will ſufficiently and eaſily be avoided.</p>
            <p>1. None will flee to the ſaid Forms, to<note place="margin">Of their three-fold abuſe.</note> draw and take from them, as from Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains with a Faith void of doubting, thoſe things that are to be believed: and further he will not run unto them in doubtful Sences of Scripture, as the Indices of what is ſtreight and crooked: nor try and examine dark and controverted ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces by them, as by a touch-ſtone.</p>
            <p>2. None will be tyed, or ſuffer himſelf to be tyed to their Meanings upon any other terms, than ſo far and ſo long as he himſelf doth certainly find and is convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced in his Conſeience, that they accord with the Meanings of the Scriptures.</p>
            <pb n="24" facs="tcp:42753:17"/>
            <p>3.

<pb n="26" facs="tcp:42753:18"/> may profitably, and without the Scandal of the Godly, be made uſe of. It is the part of Prudence to weigh things, and to conſider fit times and places, wherein this or that Opinion either by word or writing may commodiouſly be propoſed. It is the part of Charity, to have a regard of perſons, that they be not offended or troubled, who ought to be edified. It is not the duty of a Prudent and Pious Man, and one truly Charitable, to uſe promiſcouſly, upon every occaſion, with all Perſons or in all Places, when he ſo thinks fit, the liberty of contradicting, nay nor alwaies &amp; everywhere patiently to bear with all the Contradictions of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.<note place="margin">Againſt the unbri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dled Licen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiouſneſs of ſome.</note> There is often a regard to be had both of the Things or Opinions which are contradicted, and of the Perſons with whom ſuch Contradictions are propoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded. For there are ſome things of ſo great Weight and Moment, that they cannot be gain-ſaid without the extream hazard of our Salvation. Freely to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradict theſe, or quietly to ſuffer them to be contradicted by others, would be the fartheſt from Prudence and Charity poſſible. There are ſome things of that
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:42753:18"/> nature, that they may without the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of any Mans Salvation ſuffer indeed contradiction, but which yet to contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict is not neceſſary for the ſake of the publick good, and to be contradicted eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry-where and at all times, is not expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent. For not every thing, that is law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, is preſently alſo expedient and edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying. Very often the weakneſs of others ought to give law to our liberty: and not ſeldom alſo the importuneneſs of others, who have an itch after or unto variances, brablings, and contradictions, and are pleaſed with the opportunity of ſtrife &amp; contention upon every occaſion. To the one we muſt not give occaſion of offence, leſt they fall: From the other we muſt withhold all encouragements, leſt they hurt themſelves and others. For in this manner we ought alwaies to ſhun all en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dangerings of the Faithful, eſpecially of the weak, leſt we abuſe our liberty to the deſtruction of any one, but uſe it aright and to the edification of all. But in things not altogether neceſſary, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt thoſe, whom the Scripture calleth perfect, and who have their ſences exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed in the Scriptures to diſcern be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:42753:19"/> what is true and falſe, or who are more then ordinarily deſirous of Truth that is more abſtruſe, this liberty may alwaies have or take place without offence or danger. For their induſtry indeed is ſharpned by moderate contradictions, which are as it were the Whetſtones of Truth, and from which, as from the ſtrik<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or beating of Flints againſt each other, this Fruit is drawn or produced, that either they ſee clearly that errour that formerly lay hid, or are more ſolidly confirmed in the truth they hold. Which fruit cannot but afterward redound unto the whole Church, and that to the eminent promo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of truth and the glory of Gods name. But to digladiate or ſtrive with gain-ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings before the people out of the Pulpit, and to deſire or endeavour by the vellica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions or twitchings of publick Forms, and Obtrectations or Back-bitings out of the Desk or Pue, to make a Tumult among the rude common people, or by publick Writings to traduce and contumeliouſly to provoke and inveigh againſt others, would be next unto madneſs, and moſt ſcandalous and dangerous. Nor indeed can the knowledge of an unneceſſary
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:42753:19"/> truth ever do ſo much good, as the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portune and immodeſt inculcating or urging thereof may do harm and preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice both publickly and privately. And thus far concerning the firſt caution dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently to be obſerved in Confeſſions.</p>
            <p>The ſecond thing that is to be obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved<note place="margin">Nor bands of Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences.</note> as to the right uſe of Forms, flows from the firſt: if to wit there be not contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved of ſuch Forms of Confeſſions and Declarations certain Spiritual Bonds, Stocks and Fetters, whereunto the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences. Tongues and Pens of the Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers be not ſo tied and faſtned, that none may recede from the phraſes thereof, manner of ſpeaking, order, method, &amp;c. but that he is alſo forthwith ſuſpected and accuſed of Heterodoxie, who is found to expound the Divine Scripture, and ſentiments of his own mind, in other expreſſions or other order or method, then what are expreſſed in them, <hi>i.e.</hi> in thoſe Forms of Confeſſions. For by this means that liberty, which ſo long as the truth of the Sences or Meanings them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves remain ſafe, ought to continue whole and entire to all Believers in their expounding the Scriptures, as they ſhall
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:42753:20"/> judg meet, for the greateſt furtherance of the Truth, and edifying of Churches, is not only caſt out of doors and baniſhed out of the Church, but alſo the authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the Word of God is ſecretly and as it were by mines ſupplanted and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thrown by the ſame. For it can hardly otherwiſe be, but that where the expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of ſuch Forms begin to be of more account than thoſe of the Word of God it ſelf, there the Authority of the Word of God ſhould by degrees grow vile, and ſink in eſtimation beneath thoſe Forms. And indeed if we will but mind it, the chief, and haply firſt ſtep, whereby humane Forms aſcended to the height of an uſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped Authority and Majeſty almoſt Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine, was this, that at the firſt they at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed to the phraſes, words, order and method thereof more than was meet; as if in them all ſences to be believed, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped and practiſed, were more clearly, briefly and ſubſtantially expreſt, than in thoſe which we meet with in the Scriptures. For from hence hath the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteem of them by little and little been en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed, and that of the Scriptures leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſened: inſomuch that according to the

               </gap>lmoſt ſwear unto the words thereof. The which pernicious abuſe, and ſo manifeſt a corruption and inconvenience to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand and prevent, we ought at all times earneſtly and almoſt only to inculate or repeat, that ſuch Forms of Declarations are not made for that end for to teach, that the Sences or Meanings of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Religion may or ought moſt commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diouſly to be expreſſed in this order, in this method, in theſe phraſes or manners of ſpeaking, and not in others; but that in or by them they may be expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed rightly and commodiouſly enough, or that in the judgment of thoſe very Men
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:42753:21"/> that make ſuch Confeſſions, they are ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry exactly and truly contained in them. For ſo to uſe them will not be a matter of abſolute neceſſity, but of meer liberty; and he that uſeth them, will indeed do well, and yet he will not be judged to do ill that uſeth them not, eſpecially if he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the ſum of ſaving doctrine delivered in them, and do not condemn thoſe who<note place="margin">That they are not li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits nor bounds within which Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion is to be ſhut up.</note> in this point diſſent.</p>
            <p>The third thing, which flows from thoſe things that have been already ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of, neceſſary unto the right uſe of Forms, is this, That theſe Forms be not at any time held for limits and bounds, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in which Religion and the ſaving know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg of God is believed in ſuch manner to conſiſt, as if they, who cannot in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience aſſent to them or give their voice for them, were therefore excluded from Salvation, and ſhut out of the Kingdom of Heaven. Far be that from us, who firm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly believe that Chriſtians may unwitting<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly err in many things without the loſs of Salvation, and who judg that there are very few things, that are preciſely neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to be known and believed for the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining Eternal Life. Wherefore that
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:42753:21"/> we may demonſtrate that this proud cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty is exceeding far from us, we do open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſhew and declare, that Forms of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſions and Declarations are to be had in no other reſpect or account, than for cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Enſigns and Standards ſet up, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they declare, who ſet them forth, that they judg, that thoſe Sences, which are contained in thoſe Forms, do come very near the Truth, and therefore, unleſs they were taught better, do heartily de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire and wiſh, that all others that are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirous of Truth and Peace would em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace them, not indeed properly for this end, that ſo at length they might be ſaved, but that they might withdraw themſelves from the danger of erring to the greateſt diſtance may be. For neither ought it to ſeem enough to a Chriſtian, to make to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards Eternal Salvation by every means and in every way whatſoever: the ſafeſt and ſureſt is to be choſen, except haply a juſt fear of ſome greater danger or ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dal in the Church hinder the ſame. For the good of Eternal Hapineſs and of an immortal life ought to be of ſo great price with him, that he ought to hate and carefully to ſhun all dangers, which
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:42753:22"/> may turn away, or withdraw his mind from imbracing the ſame. Nor hath he any reaſon to fear, that he doth there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore abet and patronize Schiſme, which the Apoſtle calleth a work of the fleſh. For if he haply depart from ſome Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregations to others, he doth not forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with contemn thoſe, which he leaveth, or judg them as excluded from the hope of Salvation, but only goes from thoſe that are more impure to thoſe that are more pure, that he may ſhew, that he hath a care and tender regard of every truth any ways ſerving to his own Salvation, and approve his Conſcience unto God and our Lord Jeſus Chriſt. Nevertheleſs in the mean while he does his endeavour ſedulouſly to maintain Peace and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord with all that are truly pious, as far as is poſſible, and to teſtifie his mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, or <note n="*" place="margin">

Further<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more in the next place, it hardly falleth out, but that, if ſuch Forms of Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations be not ſometimes ſet forth, a wide gap is opened unto other miſcarria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges and inconveniences, if not more grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous, yet at leaſt alike and equal, and a way is eaſily pav'd unto a diſſolute li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centiouſneſs of fooliſhly venting every thing, at leaſt no better than tyranny: Laſtly ſeeing by that means, which we have ſpoken of, we may timouſly with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand thoſe miſcarriages and inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>encies, which ſome think will ariſe from thence. For if thoſe, who have thought meet to ſet forth Confeſſions and Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations of their belief, had always kept within the ſaid uſe of them, they had ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver had place given them for their exceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive authority in the Church. But after that an exact account ceaſed to be had thereof, their Authority began by little and little, and as it were by degrees to be advanced, inſomuch that the Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences, Eyes, Tongues and Pens of Men
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:42753:25"/> became to depend on them, as upon cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Standards, and undoubted Rules of Faith. Whence afterward it came to paſs, that ſome by means of them, as it were by certain letters of Heraulds at Arms, have denounced War againſt all other Congregations, and that they might have no hope of reconcilement left them, the aſſemblies of Chriſtians thereby have been divided and ſeparated one from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother, even as Empires heretofore by Boundaries, and Enemies Camps by Trenches and Bulwarks. Laſtly, which is the utmoſt line of Tyranny, that they have puniſhed thoſe, who did contradict theſe Forms with Force and Sword, and that with ſo great a zeal and heat, yea fury, that, when prophane Perſons, Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly, Diſpiſers of the Scriptures and Atheiſts are upon very eaſy terms pardo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, theſe alone are deſtined to Priſons, Racks, Wheels, Gallowſes, Croſſes, Flames, and all the moſt exquiſite puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and torments imaginable, and all for this only end, that the Authority of theſe Forms may be freed from contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction, and vindicated from contempt, and by that means forſooth the outward
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:42753:25"/> Peace of the Church, and quiet of the Common-Wealth may be preſerv'd undiſturb'd. The which way of proce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure, as it ought moſt juſtly to be hated and abominated of all Chriſtians, ſo hath it all along exceedingly diſliked us, who indeed religiouſly fear to give or grant to any Writings, Decrees or Ordinances of Men any Authority whatever either directive or coactive in matters relating to Faith and Conſcience, or to ſuffer the ſame to be given by others.</p>
            <p>From hence, pious Reader, thou<note place="margin">The ſcope of this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion.</note> wilt eaſily underſtand, what was our end and aim, which we propounded to our ſelves in ſetting forth this Declaration. Indeed, the very ſame we ſaid before, and none other. For this Declaration is not put forth to that intent, that thereby a new ſnare of Conſciences ſhould be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared, or a conſtant Square and Rule of Faith and Doctrine preſcribed to any, to wit, which ſhould abſolutely bind the Conſciences of Men before God, and therefore none ſhould depart from it e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven in the leaſt, to wit, neither in Matter nor in Words, nay nor in method or manner of Teaching. Far be ſo proud a
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:42753:26"/> vanity from us, who know that this ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour agreeth not with any Writings of Men, how accurate ſoever, and diligent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and long and much conſidered, but only with the Word of God contained in the Holy Scriptures; and who both know that from the abuſe of ſuch Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings, which is too frequent and too com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, new Schiſms, Sects, Condemnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, Perſecutions, and other Scandals of that kind have more often ariſen, and do ſeriouſly bewail the ſame. And this was our principal aim, To ſatisfie the often earneſt requeſts of thoſe, who judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that we owed this Service both to the Church and Common-Wealth, and indeed for to promote the Publick good, that is, both for the more ample illuſtrating the Truth of God, and for the the more happy procuring and on every ſide propagating of Peace in them both. Another end is, that we might by this means the more commodiouſly vindicate the truth of our Opinions and our Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency againſt the inique accuſations of thoſe, who when as themſelves hold grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous and very hurtful errours, among o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, that in the firſt place concerning fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:42753:26"/> Predeſtination, and other points an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>next thereto, (as alſo concerning the killing of Hereticks) yet will be thought the only Orthodox Men, and the altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther pure Reformed, and ſtick not to fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſten upon us not only Errours, but alſo Hereſies and Blaſpemies, yea who while themſelves exerciſe new dominion in the Church, and do not only cauſe Schiſms and Sects, but do alſo every where raiſe up direful Perſecutions and Baniſhments againſt harmleſs Men, do nevertheleſs complain of us (whom having in part in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed cited in their Conventicle of <hi>Dort,</hi> they very lately condemned, yet unheard, and without making our defence) more than Calumniouſly as of the true Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors forſooth of all the Scandals and Diſturbances, that have been hitherto made in the <hi>Belgick</hi> Churches. For the fuller conviction therefore of theſe Men, before God and the whole Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian World, of their manifeſt calumnie, and manifold injuſtice hitherto uſed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt us, and withal for the truer infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of all that are pious, and lovers or ſtudious of the Truth of God and the Churches Peace, we have thought not
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:42753:27"/> without weighty and juſt cauſe, that we were bound to ſet forth this publick and unanimous Declaration of our judgment touching almoſt the whole Chriſtian Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion. In the framing indeed whereof we have firſt of all diligently endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that there might not be omitted there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in any Opinion or Doctrine, either ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, or very uſeful, and that there might not be any thing, either falſe, or confuſed, or laſtly any thing idle and ſuperfluous contained in the ſame. But that it might comprehend in it the very form of ſound, or rather of healing words, which abundantly expreſs unto us Chriſtian Faith and Piety, both briefly and plainly, and no leſs methodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally, and as it were in a brief ſurvey hold forth the whole thereof to be viewed of all: and that by the unanimous conſent of all the Brethren, (not ſo much as ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepting thoſe who are held ſhut up in Goals) all which jointly and ſeverally diligently read it before, and in the fear of the Lord examined it by the rule of the Holy Scripture, as far as they might by reaſon of the iniquity of the times, and at length with one Heart and one

            <p>This falſe accuſation of theirs, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though long ſince elſewhere often detect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and ſufficiently refuted by us, yet had we rather obviate it even by a publick and general Declaration of our Belief, than by other means more lyable to ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumnie. So ſecure is a good Conſcience and the Confidence of a good Cauſe, which we have thought worth our while, even upon this occaſion publickly to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare. And this among others was a cauſe, why we conceived or framed it not in meer Scripture-Words, leſt we ſhould indeed nouriſh that ſuſpition, to wit, that we ſought lurking Holes, and hid, as ſome indeed think, miſchievous and prophane meanings under an equivo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal covering of the words of the Sacred Scripture: and that we might by this means cut off all new matter of calumni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ating from thoſe, whoſe ſolemn ſtudy and chief labour it is to blur and ſtain, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der any pretence or colour whatſoever, the credit and good name of the <hi>Remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrants</hi> with heinous reproaches, or at leaſt with ſiniſter ſuſpicions.</p>

               <p>1. FAith in Jeſus Chriſt is a <note n="*" place="margin">Heb. 11. 1, &amp;c.

Heb. 4. 16. Eph. 3. 12, 17.</note> Jeſus Chriſt himſelf, as our only Prophet, Prieſt, and King, given unto us of God his pure Grace, for

               <p>2. Therefore knowledg <note n="|" place="margin">Joh. 13. 17.</note> of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Will alone, or of all thoſe ſenſes, that are ſavingly neceſſary to be known, to wit, which are contained in the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, is not enough to ſpeak a true ſaving Faith. For this may be both without aſſent and truſt, yea is really <note n="*" place="margin">Jam. 2. 14, &amp;c. Luk. 13. 47. Tit. 1. 16.</note> in the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils themſelves, and in many ungodly and unbelieving Men. Nor indeed is it every aſſent, to wit, <note n="†" place="margin">Mat. 13. 22.

               <p>4. And that this aſſent may commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diouſly<note place="margin">Two things ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary for the getting of Faith.</note> be drawn from us, there are two things chiefly neceſſary. 1. Such Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments or Reaſons on God's part, unto which nothing can probably or with any ſhew of reaſon be oppoſed, why thoſe things ſhould not be credible, or deſerve our belief, which are propoſed to us. 2. A pious docility or teachableneſs, or honeſty of Mind in him, of whom this
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:42753:80"/> belief is required. For all Men <note n="*" place="margin">2 Theſ. 3. 2.</note> have not Faith. And he that will do the Will of God, he ſhall <note n="†" place="margin">Joh. 7. 17.</note> know (or underſtand) whether the Doctrine of Chriſt be from God or no. But he that doth evil, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth <note n="|" place="margin">Joh. 3. 19, 20, 21.</note> the Light, neither cometh he to the Light, leſt his deeds ſhould be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved: but he that doth the Truth, he cometh to the Light, that his deeds may be made manifeſt, for that they are wrought in God. Alſo he that is of God, <note n="*" place="margin">Joh. 8. 47. &amp; 10. 26, 27. Act. 2. 41. &amp; 13. 46, &amp;c.</note> heareth Gods words; therefore ye be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing wicked hear not, becauſe ye are not of God. Alſo ye believe not, becauſe ye are not of my ſheep.</p>
               <p>5. Such a fiducial aſſent therefore, or<note place="margin">Its con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexion with good works.</note> this obediential truſt or relyance, is at length that true and living Faith, which neceſſarily draws along with it a keeping of the Commandments of Jeſus Chriſt, <note n="†" place="margin">Joh. 5. 3, 4, 5.

For he that truly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves, and is certainly perſwaded, that Jeſus Chriſt is ordained of God to be an Author of Salvation to all that obey him; and that live piouſly and holily; and to them or ſuch only: and that it is impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible that Men ſhould any other way <note n="|" place="margin">Heb. 5. 9. &amp; 11. 6 &amp; ch. 12. 14, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p>1. OF good Works ſome are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon<note place="margin">The divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion and ſum of good works.</note> 
                  <note n="*" place="margin">Mat. 5, &amp; 6, &amp; 7.</note> unto all Chriſtians in general, others are <note n="†" place="margin">Eph. 5. 22, &amp;c. &amp; 6. 1, &amp;c.</note> proper to Chriſtians of certain vocations or callings. The ſum of thoſe, which are common to all Chriſtians alike without difference, may be comprized under theſe three heads. 1. In our loving of God and our Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, which is wholly contained in the Moral Law, as it is expounded by Jeſus Chriſt. 2. In the directing or denying of our ſelves. 3. In daily pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing unto God, and giving him thanks for his benefits received.</p>
               <p>2. The Decalogue is an Epitome or a<note place="margin">The ſum of the Decal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ogue.</note> brief ſummary of the Moral Law, which is contained in two Tables: of which the firſt contains four Commandments, and the ſecond ſix. <note n="|" place="margin">Exod. 20. Deut. 5, &amp; 6. Mat. 22. 37, 38, 39, 40. Mar. 11. 30, 31.</note> The one immediately and firſtly reſpecteth our loving of God,
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:42753:84"/> the other our love of our Neighbour. Both of them have for the moſt part ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Precepts, and altogether negative, which bind in all places, at all times, and abſolutely. Under which are compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended alſo affirmative and ſpecial Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts every where in the Scripture not a few: unto both which it is neceſſary that a Chriſtian Heart always diligently attend.</p>
               <p>3. The firſt Precept of the former Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble<note place="margin">The firſt command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment againſt Idolatry.</note> commandeth, that we have not ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther God (much leſs other Gods) before him the one true God, or beſides him, that is, <note n="*" place="margin">Deut. 6. 11, 12, &amp;c. ch. 32. 16, 17. 1 King. 11. 4, &amp;c. &amp; 12. 28. Jer. 2. 11, 12, 13. Mat. 4. 10. 1 Theſſ. 1. 9. Act. 14. 15. Gal. 4. 8.</note> that we do not either we our ſelves according to our pleaſure deviſe, or by tradition from others, without the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs Command of God, admit of any thing whatſoever (whether true or feign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, whether created, or made, whether alive, or dead, whether rational or brute) whereunto to attribute, whether directly or indirectly, either Divine Nature and Power, or Properties, or Actions, or Divine Authority or Command and Rule over us: and that we honour it not with ſuch Actions, either inward or out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, which may argue a certain opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:42753:84"/> of Divinity aſcribed to it: ſuch as are Acts <note n="†" place="margin">Deut. 6. 13. &amp; 10. 20</note> of Religious Worſhip, ſuppoſe of Faith that is due to God and Chriſt, and withall of Hope, Truſt, Love, Fear, Adoration, Invocation and of anſwerable Praiſe and giving of Thanks, which ariſe from thence; alſo of outward Sacrifice, Oath, Vow, or other ſuch like Sacred Devotion. For whoſoever giveth ſuch like honour as this, either to any thing, <note n="†" place="margin">Eph. 5. 5. Phil. 3. 19. Iſa. 44. 16, 17. Jer. 2. 27.</note> or Perſon, or performeth about or to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards it ſuch like acts as theſe, he is ſaid in Scripture to have that thing or Perſon for his God. Therefore the meaning of the Precept is, that we ought diligently to avoid all Idolatry, both inward and out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward: and on the contrary, that we ought always religiouſly to worſhip <note n="|" place="margin">Mat. 4. 10. Jer. 17. 13. Pſal. 50. 14, 15. &amp; 116. 5, 6. Rev. 14. 7. &amp; 15. 4. &amp; 19. 10.</note> that one true God, who hath revealed himſelf un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to us in his Word: that is, that we right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly know him, holily love and fear him, ſuppliantly adore him, humbly call up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him with a pure Heart, laud and praiſe him, and continually place our whole hope and confidence in him alone, as the only Author and Fountain of all Good.</p>
               <pb n="158" facs="tcp:42753:85"/>
               <p>4. The ſecond Commandment is, that<note place="margin">The ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond is againſt worſhiping of Images.</note> we do not worſhip and reverence Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, or the likneſs of any ſort or kind: that is, that we do not fall <note n="*" place="margin">Lev. 16. 1, &amp;c.

Phil. 3. 19.</note> even when a Man pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſeth and openly declareth, that he doth not count thoſe Images, or Reſemblances before whom he doth thoſe things, for God. For in ſuch manner of forbidden Worſhip God doth not judg of the acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons by or according to the Mind or intent of the Worſhipper, but rather judgeth of the Mind by the actions: So that Men are ſaid to make that an Idol, and really to call it their God and their Father, which they worſhip in this manner, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they know that it is nothing but
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:42753:85"/> a Stone or a Stock, yea and alſo proteſt that they account it ſuch: <note n="|" place="margin">1 Cor. 10. 14, 15, &amp;c.</note> but on the contrary that we do carefully avoid all this kind of outward Idolatry, and as the Apoſtle <hi>John</hi> warneth us, <note n="*" place="margin">1 Joh. 5. 21.</note> that we flee from Idols, to wit, being aſſured by the Apoſtle <hi>Paul,</hi> 
                  <note n="†" place="margin">2 Cor. 6. 16.</note> that the Temple of God hath no Communion with Idols.

               <p>5. The third Commandment is, that<note place="margin">The third Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement is againſt Blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my and vain Oathes</note> we do not uſe the Name of God in vain or raſhly: that is, that we do not at any time in our Words or Speech <note n="*" place="margin">Lev. 19. 12.

<pb n="160" facs="tcp:42753:86"/> ſeduce others: but on the contrary; that ſpeaking of God and the things of God, we uſe thoſe words, and that ſpeech, which are fulleſt both of Holineſs and Godly Gravity, and alſo moſt reverenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al of God and the Sacred Scripture: and that our Communications, according to the appointment of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, be yea and nay: or if at any time we be religiouſly to ſwear (which indeed even now alſo is altogether <note n="*" place="margin">Rom. 1. 9. &amp; 9. 1. 2 Cor. 1. 23. &amp; 11. 31.

               <p>6. As for the fourth Commandment<note place="margin">The fourth of ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying the Sabbath.</note> of ſanctifying the Sabbath-day, or the Seventh, it was indeed ſtrictly to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved in the Old Teſtament; <note n="†" place="margin">Deut. 5. 12, &amp;c.</note> but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe <note n="|" place="margin">Rom. 14. 5, 6.

<pb n="161" facs="tcp:42753:86"/> of the New Teſtament, no Chriſtian is preciſely bound to the obſervation there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of.

                  <hi>CHAP. XIII.</hi> Of directing and denying of our ſelves, and bearing of the Croſs of Chriſt.</head>
               <p>1. BEſide the Precepts we have alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy<note place="margin">What the directing of our ſelves is.</note> ſpoken of, there is this alſo required, <note n="*" place="margin">Rom. 6. 12, 13, 16. &amp; 12. 1. 2 Cor. 7. 1.</note> that we direct and order, or diligently compoſe and frame our ſelves according to the Rule and Preſcript of the Divine Will. Which indeed may two ways eſpecially be effected. 1. If we wholly <note n="†" place="margin">Luke. 9. 23, &amp;c. ch. 14. 16, &amp;c.</note> deny our ſelves and all things that are ours. 2. If we do <note n="|" place="margin">1 Joh. 2. 15, 16. Mat. 10. 38. &amp; 16. 24.</note> in no wiſe love this preſent World and the Luſts thereof; but rather for God's ſake do freely forſake all, even thoſe things which are moſt dear unto us, and to that end and purpoſe, continually following Jeſus Chriſt, and treading in his ſteps, we refuſe not, nor ſhun to bear his Croſs.</p>
               <p>2. Now we deny our ſelves aright in this<note place="margin">The deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of our ſelves is three fold.</note> manner. Firſt, when in the worſhip of God we do not in the leaſt take counſell
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:42753:91"/> of our own carnal Reaſon and worldly Prudence or Policie: <note n="*" place="margin">Mat. 11. 25, &amp;c. 1 Cor. 1. 19, &amp;c. &amp; 3. 18, 19. Iſa. 5. 21. Prov. 3. 7.</note> but in all things follow the guidance and command of him alone, (and that willingly and without any ſcruple) who alone cannot err himſelf, and will not deceive others. In the next place, when we wholly ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject our corrupt Affections to the Will of God, and <note n="†" place="margin">Rom. 8. 6, 7, 12, &amp;c. Gal. 5. 17. Tit. 2. 12. Eph. 4. 22, 23, 24. Col. 3. 8, 12.</note> chiefly that particular Affection, whereby we are more eaſily and readily enclined and ſwayed unto ſome certain Vices, (or ſometimes unto ſome one) and when by contrary Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues and thoſe works of the Spirit, which the Apoſtle reckons up, Gal. 5. we do as it were crucifie them, and reduce them into order: ſuppoſe Anger by Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleneſs and Meekneſs; Moroſneſs by Courteouſneſs; Sloth by Zeal and Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour; Sadneſs by Joy; Litigiouſneſs by Facility and Peaceableneſs &amp;c. Laſt<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly, we deny our ſelves moſt of all, and indeed moſt properly, when we are ready for Chriſt's ſake to put off that firſt and moſt natural Love, <note n="|" place="margin">Mat 16. 24. Luke. 14. 26. Joh. 12. 25. Act. 20. 24. &amp; 21. 13.</note> whereby we are wholly enclined to favour our Lives and the Happineſs, or Accommendation thereof: and refuſe not to forſake our
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:42753:92"/> lives themſelves, yea to loſe them with or by the greateſt pain and torment, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than endure to commit any thing unworthy of our Profeſſion, and the glorious Religion of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>3. We then deny this World and<note place="margin">A three<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold deni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al of the luſts of the World.</note> the Luſts thereof, or love them not, <note n="*" place="margin">1 Joh. 2. 15, 16. † 1 Cor. 3. 1, &amp;c.

Luke 21. 34.

<pb n="173" facs="tcp:42753:92"/> is enjoyned us of God, or to the loſs and prejudice of better and heavenly Cares. The which indeed doth then uſually come to paſs, when <note n="†" place="margin">Rom 12. 11, &amp;c. Phil. 3. 20.

               <p>4. And indeed we then love not the<note place="margin">A mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate uſe and deſire of earthly things.</note> good things of this World too immode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately, when we neither deſire to enjoy the World it ſelf, <note n="|" place="margin">1 Cor. 7. 29, 30, 31, 32.

<pb n="174" facs="tcp:42753:93"/> ſo far as is ſufficient to ſatisfy natural neceſſity, and our leading a life worthy of a Chriſtian.

For the Church, whilſt it is mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant<note place="margin">In what reſpects it is invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible.</note> here on earth, is wont according to the Sacred Scripture to be conſidered under a twofold reſpect. 1.

Therefore all thoſe Churches, which a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree in the belief and profeſſion of neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary Truth, we believe that they ought to be counted for true Churches of Jeſus Chriſt: although in the mean time they differ in many other things, and in ſome reſpects not inconſiderably ſwerve from the Truth.</p>
               <p>5.

For if the ſin be <note n="|" place="margin">Mat. 18. 15, &amp;c.</note> ſecret, or yet not publickly known, there needeth only but a private admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition: and that ſometimes repeated, making uſe alſo of thoſe that are privy to it, or of witneſſes if need be.

               <p>8.

Wherefore they, who exerciſe this<note place="margin">A confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of a pernici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous error.</note> ſame diſcipline not only with a fleſhly power, and coactive force, but who do alſo extend it unto bodily and capital puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments (eſpecially under pretence and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour of Hereſie, commonly ſo called) they do arrogate and aſſume to themſelves too great a power, yea altogether unmeet and <note n="†" place="margin">Mat. 13. 28, 29, 30.

               <p>And this at length is our judgment of all, or at leaſt of the chief Articles of Chriſtian Religion, whereby Chriſtian Reader, whoever you are, you may eaſily underſtand, and moſt clearly ſee, that we are free and clear from all thoſe Hereſies, Schiſmes and other noiſom and ungodly Opinions, which have been hitherto by our Adverſaries ſlanderouſly faſtened up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on us: And that we do not dig up again, or, as they ſay, hang up upon a new Poſt or Pole any erroneous Opinious and ſuch as have been condemned by the ancient and firſt Profeſſors of Chriſtianity: alſo that we do not ſhake, nor ſubvert thoſe things, which have been at any time e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtabliſhed by the Church of Chriſt by uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal conſent: that we do not define, nor obſtinately and proudly decide in thoſe things, which have long ſince been dubiouſly controverted to and fro, and which make not greatly either for the promoting of the Glory of God, or of our own Salvation or our Neighbour's: fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally that we do not operouſly &amp; ſubtilly ſeatch into thoſe things, which are not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed to us: leſt indeed we intrude our
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:42753:136"/> ſelves into thoſe things, which the moſt wiſe God would have to be kept ſecret. But that we make this our only and ſole endeavour, that we may preſerve whole and entire that Truth, which is accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Godlineſs, and which it concerns us all ſolidly for to know, and that we e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very where purſue, and, as much as in us lyeth, promote thoſe things which make, both for the maintaining or cheriſhing, and promoting of mutual Peace and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord amongſt Chriſtians; always remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bring that advice of the Apoſtle's, <hi>Tit. 3. 8. This is a faithful ſaying, and theſe things I will that thou conſtantly affirm <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, that they which have believed in God be careful to maintain</hi> (or go before, or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel others in) <hi>good Works. For theſe are good,</hi> (excellent) <hi>and profitable to</hi> (for) <hi>Men:</hi> and that which the Apoſtle elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where exhorteth unto; <hi>Follow ye peace with all Men, and Holineſs; without which no Man ſhall ſee the Lord,</hi> Heb. 12. 14. In theſe two is placed the chiefeſt Glory of the Chriſtian Religion. With theſe therefore hitherto we are wholly taken up. But about things unneceſſary, and not greatly profitable to Salvation, we are loth to draw to and fro the Saw of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention,
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:42753:137"/> and the Myſteries indeed; that are ſublime &amp; abſtruſe, we receive with a ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple Faith and free from all ſcrupulous ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilneſs of Wit and Reaſon, nor but ſoberly and ſparingly, and as one of the Ancients is reported not unfitly to have ſaid, we handle not the burning Iron without Tongs. And as for unprofitable Specu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations and vain Niceties, we keep at the fartheſt diſtance from them, for that they rather gender or produce ſtrifes and que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtions, <hi>than godly edifying which is by Faith,</hi> 1 Tim. 1. 4. Concerning things indifferent, as alſo Rites and Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, we lightly trouble no Man, ſo that the offending of the Weak be diligently avoided on the one hand, and Superſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion carefully provided againſt on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Finally, we direct all our ſtudies to this mark, that we may hold forth thoſe things which are either neceſſary, or very profitable to ſubſtantial Piety and our own everlaſting Salvation, and that in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther things we may willingly and readily tolerate and bear with all that diſſent from us, and heartily follow, maintain and cheriſh peace and concord in all the Churches of Jeſus Chriſt, although in our opinion or judgment they are out of the
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:42753:137"/> way. Which things being ſo, we earneſtly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat and beſeech you by the Lord, (Chriſtian Reader, whoever you are) that you would not give any room with your ſelf unto any ſuſpicions to the contrary, nor admit of the unjuſt Accuſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, Calumnies and Slanders of our Enemies, or eaſily harken unto thoſe, whoſe chiefeſt intereſt it is that we ſhould be evil ſpoken of, leſt they ſhould ſeem to have condemned and baniſhed us undeſervedly, and as innocent: but that having a careful regard to Right and Equity, you would paſs judgment of us according to this our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion and publick Declaration of our Belief. If in any thing haply you ſuppoſe or believe us to err, inſtruct us in the Spirit of Gentleneſs and Meeekneſs, which moſt highly becometh the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants of Jeſus Chriſt. We are ready in all pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and at all times, to yeild to thoſe who ſhall ſhew us better, and give place to the Truth of God, which is more precious to us than all things elſe. If at any time notwithſtanding, or in any place, we diſſent and differ in things not neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to be known, let us bear with one another in the Lord; and being mindful both of Chriſtian Charity and Prudence, let us ſtudy to keep the unity of the Spirit through or in the bond of Peace, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4. 3. Nevertheleſs in that, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto by the help and guidance of Chriſt we have already attained, let us walk by the ſame rule,
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:42753:138"/> and be alike minded or affected. <hi>and if in any thing we be otherwiſe-minded, God will reveal even this unto us.</hi> Phil. 3. 15, 16.</p>
               <p>Grant he, that we may daily more and more to his Glory grow and make progreſs in true Faith, Piety, Charity, Prudence, Gentleneſs, Meekneſs, and other holy Endowments and Chriſtian Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, and endeavour patiently to bear with, and gently or mildly to amend one anothers Infirmiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, Errors, and Failings, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing<note place="margin">Eph. 3. 17, 18, 19, 20, 21.</note> rooted and grounded in Love, we may be able together with all Saints to apprehend, what is that breadth, and length, and depth and heighth and that love of Jeſus Chriſt which paſſeth all underſtanding, that ſo we may be filled even unto or with the whole fulneſs of God. To him, who with infinite redundan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy is able to do above all thoſe things which we ask or think, according to that power which worketh in us, to him, we ſay, be Glory in the Church by Chriſt Jeſus, throughout all ages, World without end.</p>
